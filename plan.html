<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Xavier McKinley</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Improve customer/players - to design a website that can increase the customers by at least fifty percentage.</li>
  <li>Increase Awareness &ndash; this website will make Slammers Beach Volleyball be seen a lot more and easily and will make it simple for people who are interested to research the competition and see if they would like to join.</li>
  <li>Improve Customer Satisfaction &ndash; Just by having a website that flows correctly and has all the needed information the customers will find it very helpful and simple to use.</li>
  <li>Reduce Time to Complete a Task &ndash; It will have the Ladder, sign up page and other information on the site, now customers only have to search up and they can see or do what they need in a very short time.</li>
  <li>Optimize Workflow Automation &ndash; Making the website run without any problems or bugs, to design a website that flows freely, allowing users to navigate easily and find what they need quickly and efficiently.</li>
  <li>Strive for a design that&rsquo;s user-friendly and beautiful. - A great user-interface is often sacrificed for a wonderful design, but both are equally important and should go hand in hand. A well-designed site helps users travel through your site with ease. Items are where users expect them to be. </li>
  <li>Create a site that&nbsp;targets the appropriate audience &ndash; using the correct colours and themes this site will suit the younger age group and with it being simple they will not get frustrated in how to use it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>My Website has followed all the goals and has made a simple but very beautiful looking site, it flows perfectly with no problems, Then information is in easy to find areas around the website in all its own categories. There is a easy and quick sign up page to improve the customer percentage. The website is the name of the competition making it easy to find on the web so the awareness will be high. Also there is a contact page so if a customer needs help they can always call or email for assistance.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this site is to appeal to a young audience age from (15-30) who will have an interest in playing volleyball, this includes young families. For this the website was design to be partially easy to use, it is colourful and has images of young people playing. It has short texts so can be read quickly because they don't want to be sitting there reading long paragraphs. The sign &ndash; up page is nice and simple and is not confusing at all so there will be no trouble. Also the page looks exciting and appealing. </p>
